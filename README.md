# Suven-Consultants-and-Technology Internship 
# This repository consists of two projects which I have performed as a part of internship in Suven Consultant and Technology
1) Performing analysis of Meterological data - The purpose of performing this analysis is to check whether Apparent temperature and humidity over the period of (2006â€“2016) in Finland has increased or not. The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle (Source URL: https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset)
2) Handwritten digit recognition - For this purpose I have made use of Support Vector Machine(SVM) which can be imported from scikit-learn library(commonly called as sklearn) 

Requirements : Google Colab or Jupyter notebook
